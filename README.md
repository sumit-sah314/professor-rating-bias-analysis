# Bias in Professor Rating Systems â€“ Datathon Project

This repository contains our project for the Datathon challenge under the category **Social & Agricultural Economics**. Our project investigates systemic biases in professor ratings on platforms like Rate My Professors (RMP) and proposes solutions for fairer evaluations.

---

## **Project Overview**
Millions of students rely on RMP for course selection, but biases in the platform distort evaluations and mislead students. This project analyzes key biases and provides data-driven solutions.

---

## **Key Biases Analyzed**
- **Grading Leniency Bias:** Tough graders receive lower ratings, regardless of teaching quality.
- **Sampling Bias:** Most professors have fewer than 41 reviews, leading to skewed perceptions by a small group.
- **Review Extremity Bias:** Professors with fewer reviews exhibit more extreme ratings.

---

## **Data and Methods**
- **Dataset:** 20,000 RMP reviews from 1,400+ professors across 500 universities.
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.
- **Analysis:** Correlation analysis, standard deviation comparisons, and data visualization.

---

## **Proposed Solutions**
- **Use university evaluations** as primary data for fairer assessments.
- **Mandatory ratings** from students after course completion.
- **Verified reviews and weighted ratings** to reduce bias.
- **Student awareness campaigns** for honest feedback.

---

## **Repository Structure**
- `data/` â€“ Contains the dataset and processed files.
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks with analysis code.
- `plots/` â€“ Visualizations and graphs from the analysis.
- `docs/` â€“ Documentation, reports, and the final digital poster.
